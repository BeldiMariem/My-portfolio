        <h3>Beyond the Code: My Creative Side</h3>
        <p>
          While I'm passionate about building digital solutions, I also find creative expression through pencil drawing. 
          There's something meditative about putting pencil to paper and bringing ideas to life through shades and textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey with art has taught me patience, attention to detail, and the importance of seeing the bigger picture - 
          skills that directly translate to writing better code and creating more thoughtful user experiences.
        </p>
        <p class="creative-philosophy">
          "To me, both coding and drawing are about creating something meaningful from nothing - 
          whether it's with pixels or pencil strokes."
